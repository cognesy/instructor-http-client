title: Advanced Topics (Archived)
description: 'This page was archived during HTTP Client 2.0 docs cleanup.'

This topic was intentionally removed from the primary docs set to keep guidance focused on core production workflows.

Use these guides instead:

- `1-overview`
- `2-getting-started`
- `3-making-requests`
- `4-handling-responses`
- `5-streaming-responses`
- `6-pooling`
- `10-middleware`

If you need a specific advanced extension scenario, prefer package source + tests as the current reference until the advanced docs are rewritten.
